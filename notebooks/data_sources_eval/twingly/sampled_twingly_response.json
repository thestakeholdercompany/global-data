While we commend the Nasi Ispani programme for its commendable efforts in addressing youth unemployment, we look forward to further details on its continued success and expansion.</p> <p> COSATU Gauteng acknowledges the strides made in job creation through the Nasi Ispani programme, which has positively impacted the lives of many unemployed youth in the province. We hope to hear about sustained efforts and future plans to enhance this initiative and create even more opportunities for our young workforce.</p> <p> Additionally, we urgently seek updates on crucial economic initiatives, specifically the implementation progress of the pharmaceutical company and the state bank. These entities play a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape of Gauteng, and we look forward to hearing about the milestones achieved and the plans for their sustained growth.</p> <p> Service-related matters are of utmost concern to the citizens of Gauteng. We call for a dedicated focus on improving public services to ensure efficient and effective governance. A detailed plan outlining strategies to enhance service delivery will be crucial in building public trust and satisfaction.</p> <p> Energy and load shedding cannot be left out as it has a negative impact on the economic landscape of Gauteng, setting the stage for heightened anticipation ahead of the State of the Province Address. With the persistent challenges in the energy sector leading to regular power cuts, businesses in Gauteng have faced disruptions, decreased productivity, and increased operational costs. The address must shed light on the government's plans and strategies to address the impact of load shedding on the province's economy.</p> <p> Furthermore, the issue of sufficient housing remains a pressing concern. COSATU Gauteng urges the provincial government to provide updates on current housing projects and to outline future plans for addressing the housing needs of our growing population. Adequate and affordable housing is fundamental to the well-being and stability of our communities.</p> <p> Lastly, we anticipate a comprehensive strategy for economic growth within the province. COSATU Gauteng looks forward to hearing about initiatives, policies, and investments aimed at fostering economic development, job creation, and sustainable growth. A transparent and well-communicated plan will instill confidence in both the workforce and investors, contributing to the overall prosperity of Gauteng.</p> <p> Issued by COSATU Gauteng</p> <p> Provincial Chairperson (Amos Monyela): 079 493 5002</p> <p> Provincial Secretary (Louisah Modikwe): 066 182 2402 / 082 297 2659</p>",

      "title": "COSATU President Zingiswa Losi's Address: Domestic Workers' Dialogue",
      "text": "<p> Most importantly our domestic workers present,</p> <p> Thank you for gathering here today as we seek to honour the domestic workers who take care of our children, our elderly relatives and our homes whilst we are at work.</p> <p> The long hours and sacrifices that nearly one million domestic workers put in every home is the hidden backbone of our society and the economy.</p> <p> Whilst domestic workers play such an important role in our families, they do so under often the most trying conditions. The pay is little, the hours long, the days spent away from their own families painful and in too many instances they are subjected to some of the most horrific abuses, including sexual.</p> <p> We all need to do better by and with our domestic workers.</p> <p> For many years domestic workers were paid little more than a slave wage. In 2019 after extensive negotiations at Nedlac and Parliament, led by then Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a National Minimum Wage come into effect.</p> <p> It is not a living wage, that is a different objective that we must continue to strive for. The minimum wage is the level below which no worker can be paid.</p> <p> In 2019 the Minimum Wage was R20 overall and for farm and domestic workers it was R18 and R15 an hour. This was a compromise to ensure no workers were retrenched as a result of the Minimum Wage coming into effect.</p> <p> Since then, farm and domestic workers have reached the national minimum wage.</p> <p> The Minimum Wage has been consistently increased by the Minimum Wage Commission and the Minister of Employment and Labour, Thulas Nxesi, at levels above inflation to help protect workers from the rising costs of living.</p> <p> From 1 March 2024, it will be R27.58 an hour. We are pleased that government agreed to COSATU's proposal for this positive 3% above inflation increase.</p> <p> Whilst we are pleased with the progress we have made, we must do more with the Department and SADSAWU to ensure all employers abide by it and to report those who refuse to do so.</p> <p> Last year marked an historic victory in the struggle to improve the working conditions of domestic workers.</p> <p> Parliament passed the Compensation of Occupational Injuries and Diseases Amendment Act to ensure that for the first time domestic workers are insured for any injuries or diseases they experience at their workplace.</p> <p> The Amendment Act recognises the right of workers to claim compensation for post-traumatic stress or diseases and illnesses that may only show after the worker has left their place of employment. This means domestic workers suffering from PTSD due to sexual harassment or gender-based violence at work, can now claim compensation.</p> <p> Workers now have 3 years to submit claims to the Compensation Fund.</p> <p> In 2018 the Unemployment Insurance Amendment Act became law extending paid maternity leave to mothers who experienced still born births or third trimester miscarriages. Maternity leave payments were also increased.</p> <p> In the same year the Labour Laws Amendment Act came into effect, providing 10 days paid parental leave for parents of new born children who are not covered by maternity leave, e.g. fathers or mothers of children born through a surrogate pregnancy or same sex partnership.</p> <p> 10 weeks paid adoption leave is now provided when legally adopting a child two years and younger.</p> <p> If a worker passes away whilst receiving payments from the UIF or Compensation Fund, the balance owed to them must be paid to their next of kin.</p> <p> We are society marked by a cancer of gender-based violence and sexual harassment at the workplace. Parliament overhauled our criminal laws in 2021 to strengthen our tools to fight this national shame.</p> <p> Sexual offenders of any type must be recorded in a publicly accessible sexual offenders' register and prohibited from employment in positions of authority over children, the elderly or other vulnerable persons.</p> <p> The powers of the police and the courts to enter and search, arrest and detain, prosecute and convict such offenders has been significantly increased.</p> <p> Whilst we celebrate these victories, they will remain little more than nice English words on a paper, unless workers are aware of their rights, we expose employers and anyone who breaks the law, we report such persons to the Department of Employment and Labour or the Police as appropriate.</p> <p> This requires Treasury to allocate enough resources to the Department to ensure it has enough labour inspectors to visit all workplaces and ensure full compliance with our labour laws. The Department hired an additional 400 inspectors in 2020 but this is not enough.</p> <p> We are engaging the Department of Employment and Labour on a road map to modernise our the UIF, Compensation Fund and the CCMA. Workers should not be made to stand for days in queues when they are in need of help from these critical institutions.</p> <p> Modernising these Funds and the CCMA is important not only so that employers can register their employees, so that workers can apply for and receive the relief due to them, but also so we can prevent and expose those who steal workers' monies.</p> <p> It means we as COSATU and our Affiliates must visit all workplaces, recruit workers, train and empower them to understand their rights.</p> <p> We need to put in place an active plan to recruit domestic workers to join SADSAWU and to help SADSAWU become a fully-fledged union.</p> <p> Those of us who employ domestic workers must lead by example. Are we paying above the minimum wage, are we registered for the UIF and Compensation Fund, do we recognise public holidays as paid days off? Let us not pretend this is someone else's responsibility.</p> <p> These have not been easy journeys. We have won many victories as COSATU at Nedlac, at Parliament, in our Alliance with the African National Congress, in our Bargaining Councils, at the CCMA and the Labour Courts.</p> <p> We win these battles when we have strong unions. Unions can only be strong when workers join together and become members.</p> <p> We have also been able to put these victories for workers into law through our alliance with the ANC. This is critical as this allows workers to hold employers, government and businesses accountable. Those who break the laws can be taken to the CCMA or court. Workers can hold government accountable to pay what is due to them.</p> <p> It is natural, with our many challenges, to be irritated with government and even to question why should we vote and why should we vote for the ANC?</p> <p> The victories I have outlined above over the past 5 years, were due not only to COSATU's campaigns but also because we have an ally, the ANC that is the product of workers' struggles and many of whose leaders come from COSATU.</p> <p> It has not always been easy, at times we have been angered by mistakes our comrades make, but the ANC remains an ally of workers and a champion of working-class struggles.</p> <p> It is important for all of us to ensure we are registered to vote, have our IDs and come election day to vote early and vote for the ANC. We have come too far to risk losing the victories we have one or to risk losing a government and Parliament that is biased towards workers' causes.</p> <p> Allow me to conclude by thanking you for coming today. This must not be a once off occasion but the beginning of a campaign across Durban and KwaZulu-Natal to recruit, train and empower all our domestic workers, to build SADSAWU, to tackle abusive employers, to hold government accountable, to achieve that better life for all.</p> <p> Thank you. Amandla! Malibongwe!–</p>",

The National Treasury's recent notification regarding the potential loss of R630 million for the City of Tshwane and slightly over R1 billion for the City of Johannesburg, is unsettling.</p> <p> The City of Tshwane, led by the Democratic Alliance (DA), is on the verge of losing R630 million earmarked for funding various capital grants. This unfortunate situation stems from the metro's underperformance and noncompliance with the integrated urban development grants, putting at risk critical projects aimed at improving the lives of residents. COSATU Gauteng emphasizes the importance of effective governance and the responsible use of allocated funds to ensure sustainable development and upliftment of communities.</p> <p> Following closely on the heels of Tshwane, the City of Johannesburg led by the collusion government and unstable council now finds itself in a similar predicament, becoming the second Gauteng metro facing the threat of losing developmental grants due to poor expenditure on development projects. The National Treasury has signalled its intention to cut the metro's conditional grants by just over R1 billion. This decision underscores the urgent need for the City of Johannesburg to reassess its financial management practices and prioritize effective utilization of allocated resources for the benefit of its residents.</p> <p> It is urgently imperative for the municipalities involved to address the issues at hand and collaborate with the National Treasury to rectify the identified shortcomings. The potential loss of these substantial funds raises serious questions about the commitment to good governance, transparency, and accountability in the affected municipalities.</p> <p> The Federation calls for increased vigilance and oversight by both the provincial and national government to prevent the recurrence of such financial mismanagement in other municipalities. The consequences of losing these grants extend beyond the financial realm, impacting the lives and well-being of the communities that rely on these funds for crucial developmental projects.</p> <p> We will closely monitor the developments in both municipalities in the hopes that all stakeholders will work collaboratively to find swift and effective solutions to safeguard the future development and prosperity of our cities.</p> <p> Issued by COSATU Gauteng</p> <p> Provincial Chairperson (Amos Monyela): 079 493 5002</p> <p> Provincial Secretary (Louisah Modikwe): 066 182 2402 / 082 297 2659</p>",

      "text": "<p>reinstatement of 24 members of the union, who were dismissed by the Department of Water and Sanitation following the 2018 strike.</p> <p> In March 2018, as NEHAWU, we embarked on a strike action across all workplaces of the Department of Water and Sanitation after failed negotiations. A few days into that strike, a settlement agreement was reached in favour of our members and workers in general.</p> <p> The settlement agreement signed by the union and the department agreed on the cessation of hostilities, reinstatement of 24 workers who were dismissed as a result of participating in the strike.</p> <p> After having signed the settlement agreed, the department totally disregarded the settlement agreement and refused to reinstate the dismissed workers, which left the union with no other option except approaching the court. As NEHAWU, we filed a dispute to Labour Court for an enforcement of the settlement agreement directing that all 24 workers that were dismissed by the Department of Water and Sanitation be reinstated.</p> <p> The matter was set down for the 07 February 2024 in the Labour Court and the court granted an order reinstating the employees. Indeed, the union welcomes this court order as it protect workers from employers who abuse their powers by disrespecting signed settlement agreements. This victory is as a result of the hard work put in by the union a spear and shield of its members at the workplace.</p> <p> Lastly, we call on the Department of Water and Sanitation to immediately reinstate our members as per the settlement agreement without any delay.</p> <p> END</p> <p> Issued by NEHAWU Secretariat</p> <p> Zola Saphetha (General Secretary) at 082 558 5968; December Mavuso (Deputy General Secretary) at 082 558 5969; Lwazi Nkolonzi (NEHAWU National Spokesperson) at 081 558 2335 or email: lwazin@nehawu.org.za</p>",

      "text": "<p>the German prosecuting authorities and judiciary for persons involved in the Steinhoff corruption scandal.</p> <p> Monday will see the third trial commence in Germany in response to the corruption and tax scandals at Steinhoff that shocked the world and saw up to R12.5 billion worth of South African workers' hard earned pension funds looted. To date Germany has concluded two trials and secured two convictions since the scandal erupted in 2017. COSATU is dismayed by the meaningless 3 and a half years with 1 year suspended and two years wholly suspended sentences meted out to date by the German courts to the convicted.</p> <p> As pathetic as these sentences are given the billions of workers' pensions involved, at least Germany has brought some of the accused to trial. South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority's track record int the Steinhoff scandal has been nothing short of abysmal.</p> <p> It cannot be acceptable that high profile individuals are allowed to wantonly break laws, loot pension fund investments and live a lavish lifestyle and even when they are exposed in newspaper headlines, the prosecuting authorities sit and literally do nothing to bring justice to the victims and society.</p> <p> It those who run the NPA are tired or have run out of ideas, then they should spare the nation any further embarrassing lethargy and make way for those who are interested and willing to see justice done.</p> <p> The Minister of Finance, Enoch Godongwana, needs to table a bold Budget at Parliament that will ensure the NPA has the resources it needs to fulfil its constitutional mandate, in particular filling all prosecutorial vacancies. We cannot continue to be a society that normalises corruption and feeds a culture of impunity.</p> <p> For further information please contact:</p> <p> Matthew Parks</p> <p> Acting National Spokesperson &amp; Parliamentary Coordinator</p> <p> Cell: 082 785 0687</p>",

      "text": "<p>Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant for an additional year until March 2025. This will provide comfort for 8 million unemployed persons who have been receiving this critical poverty alleviation support. Whilst the SRD Grant has experienced many challenges and limitations, it has provided an invaluable source of relief for 8 million persons without a source of income and has laid the foundation for the long sought Basic Income Grant.</p> <p> Though this announcement by the Department of Social Development is positive, we are disappointed that the monetary amount of the SRD Grant has not been adjusted once for inflation since it was introduced in 2020. This is nothing short of scandalous, more so when the Members of Cabinet and Parliament who pass the Budget, have received increases to their very comfortable packages.</p> <p> COSATU hopes the commitment by the President, Cyril Ramaphosa, to extend and increase the SRD Grant in last week's State of the Nation Address will be honoured by government and see the SRD Grant increased in the April 2024/25 Budget to recover value lost to inflation since 2020 and a path be set for it to be raised to the Food Poverty Line in the November 2024's Medium Term Budget Policy Statement.</p> <p> We appreciate the fiscal constraints facing the state, however we need to do more to cushion the poor who have been decimated by the rising cost of living and struggle to find work in an anaemic economy with a 41% unemployment rate. The Budget at R2 trillion can afford to increase the SRD Grant to meet these objectives as it currently costs less than 1.5% of total expenditure yet reaches over 15% of society. The money spent on the SRD Grant is not lost as it is spent in the local economy, stimulating growth and much of it is recovered through VAT and other taxes.</p> <p> Issued by COSATU</p> <p> For further information please contact:</p> <p> Matthew Parks</p> <p> Acting National Spokesperson &amp; Parliamentary Coordinator</p> <p> Cell: 082 785 0687</p>",
